  sudo chmod 4755 chrome-sandbox
  #+END_SRC

* Commands

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pencil # Executes pencil.   
  #+END_SRC

* Pros

  - Easy to use.

  - Rapid prototiping.

  - Exports to different formats including html + css + js.

  - The quality of the html + css + js generated code is decent.


* Cons

  - Hard to install (Buster crashes installing with stable release, works
    fine with nightly build)

  - On the downloads page says - *the Firefox extension bases on an
    older version of Pencil which is no longer in active
    development*. Gives 404 error.

  - Must install the *Generic Wireframe set of figures/objects* to
    have a decent set of forms to work with.

  - By default, when exporting to an html prototype, the background
    color must always be manually set to #FFF (white).

  - When creating a new page if you don’t put a solid color (as
    white), you cannot change it later.
